      "path": "03-Usage.md",
      "url": "03-Usage.html",
      "content": "# Usage\n\n## Getting started\n\nYou first _need_ to create an index extending the `Firesphere\\SolrSearch\\Indexes\\BaseIndex` class, or if you are using the compatibility\nmodule, the `SilverStripe\\FullTextSearch\\Solr\\SolrIndex` class.\n\nIf you are extending the base Index, it will require a `getIndexName` method\nwhich is used to determine the name of the index to query Solr.\n\nAlthough the compatibility module provides a core naming scheme, it is still highly recommended\nto implement your own method.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\n\nThe usage of `YML` as a replacement for the core configuration, it  is not a replacement \nfor creating your own Index extending either of the Base Indexes, it is a compliment to it.\n\n`YML` is purely used for the configuration of the index Classes.\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nConfiguring Solr is done via YML:\n```yml\nFiresphere\\SolrSearch\\Services\\SolrCoreService:\n  config:\n    endpoint:\n      myhostname:\n        host: myhost.com\n        port: 8983\n        timeout: 10\n        # set up timeouts\n        index_timeout: 10\n        optimize_timeout: 100\n        finalize_timeout: 300\n        http_method: 'AUTO'\n        # commit within 60ms\n        commit_within: 60\n  # default path settings\n  store:\n    mode: 'file'\n    path: '.solr'\n  cpucores: 2\n\n```\n\nNote, if you are using defaults (localhost), it is not necessary to add this to your configuration.\n\nThe config is used to connect to Solr. This will tell the module where the Solr instance for this index lives and how to connect.\n\nThe store is to select the way to configure the solr configuration storage. Options are `file` and a required path, or `post` and a required endpoint to post to.\n\nPost config:\n```yml\nstore:\n  mode: 'post'\n  path: '/my_post_endpoint'\n  uri: 'https://mydomain.com'\n```\n\n#### Defining the number of CPU cores\n\nIf your server has multiple CPU cores available, you can define the number of cores in the config.\nDuring indexing, this means that each core gets to do an indexing of a group.\nThe advantage is that it takes all cores available, speeding up the indexing process by the number of cores available.\n\nBecause the number of cores can not be determined programmatically, due to access control, you will have to define \nthe number of cores available manually.\n\n\n**NOTE**\n\nGiven the current situation in server-land, the default number of cores is 2. This should work fine for\nmost situations, even if you only have one core available. If you have more cores, you can make this\nnumber larger, of course.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nUsing all cores your system has, will make your website pretty slow during indexing! It is adviced to keep\nat least one core free for handling page visits, while you're running an index.\n\n### Using init()\n\nSimilar to the FulltextSearch module, using init supports all basic methods to add fulltext or filter fields.\n\nAvailable methods are:\n\n| Method | Purpose | Required | Usage |\n|-|-|-|-|\n| addClass | Add classes to index | Yes | `$this->addClass(SiteTree::class);` |\n| addFulltextField | Add fields to index | No<sup>1</sup> | `$this->addFulltextField('Content');` |\n| addAllFulltextField | Add all text fields to index | No | `$this->addAllFulltextFields();` |\n| addFilterField | Add fields to use for filtering | No | `$this->addFilterField('ID');` |\n| addBoostedField | Fields to boost by on Query time | No | `$this->addBoostedField('Title', ([]/2), 2);`<sup>2</sup> |\n| addSortField | Field to sort by | No | `$this->addSortField('Created');` |\n| addCopyField | Add a special copy field, besides the default _text | No | `$this->addCopyField('myCopy', ['Fields', 'To', 'Copy']);` |\n| addStoredField | Add a field to be stored specifically | No | `$this->addStoredField('LastEdited');` |\n| addFacetField | Field to build faceting on | No | `$this->addFacetField(SiteTree::class, ['BaseClass' => SiteTree::class, 'Title' => 'FacetObject', 'Field' => 'FacetObjectID']);` |\n \n\n### Using YML\n\n```yml\nFiresphere\\SolrSearch\\Indexes\\BaseIndex:\n  MySearchIndex:\n    Classes:\n      - SilverStripe\\CMS\\Model\\SiteTree\n    FulltextFields:\n      - Content\n      - TestObject.Title\n      - TestObject.TestRelation.Title\n    SortFields: \n\t  - Created\n    FilterFields:\n      - Title\n      - Created\n      - Firesphere\\SolrSearch\\Tests\\TestObject\n    BoostedFields:\n\t  - Title\n    CopyFields:\n      _text:\n        - '*'\n    DefaultField: _text\n    FacetFields:\n      Firesphere\\SolrSearch\\Tests\\TestObject:\n        BaseClass: SilverStripe\\CMS\\Model\\SiteTree\n        Field: ID\n        Title: TestObject\n\n```\n\n#### MySearchIndex\n\nThis name should match the name you provided in your Index extending the `BaseIndex` you are instructed\nto create in the first step of this document.\n\n#### Moving from init to YML\n\nThe [compatibility module](Submodules/01-Fulltext-Search-Compatibility.md) has an optional extension method that allows you to build your index and then generate the YML content for you. See the compatibility module for more details.\n\n## Grouped indexing\n\nNote, grouped indexing is `0` based. Thus, if there are 150 groups to index, the final group to index will be 149 instead of 150.\n\n## Another way to set the config in PHP\n\nYou could also use PHP, just like it was, to set the config. For readability however, it's better to use variables for Facets:\n```php\n    protected $facetFields = [\n        RelatedObject::class   => [\n            'BaseClass' => SiteTree::class,\n            'Field'     => 'RelatedObjectID',\n            'Title'     => 'RelationOne'\n        ],\n        OtherRelatedObject::class => [\n            'BaseClass' => SiteTree::class,\n            'Field'     => 'OtherRelatedObjectID',\n            'Title'     => 'RelationTwo'\n        ]\n    ];\n```\n\nThis will generate a facet field in Solr, assuming this relation exists on `SiteTree` or `Page`.\n\nThe relation would look like `SiteTree_RelatedObjectID`, where `RelatedObject` the name of the relation reflects.\n\nThe Title is used to group all facets by their Title, in the template, this is accessible by looping `$Result.FacetSet.TitleOfTheFacet`\n\n### Important notice\n\nNote, that Facets are relational. For faceting on a relation, omit the origin class (e.g. `SiteTree`), but supply the full relational\npath to the facet. e.g. if you want to have facets on `RelationObject->RelationThing()->Relation()->ID`, the Facet declaration should be\n`RelationObject.RelationThing.RelationID`. It should always end with an ID that is a `has_one` relation.\n\nAlthough it can be a `has_many` just as well, and it would be `Relation.ID`, it is not advised, as it creates a lot of overhead.\n\nIt would and should work though. If you want to do it that way, there's no stopping you, it's just not advised. \n\n## Accessing Solr\n\nIf available, you can access your Solr instance at `http://mydomain.com:8983`\n\n## Excluding unwanted indexes\n\nTo exclude unwanted indexes, it is possible declare a list of _wanted_ indexes in the `YML`\n\n```yaml\nFiresphere\\SolrSearch\\Services\\SolrCoreService:\n  indexes:\n    - CircleCITestIndex\n    - Firesphere\\SolrSearch\\Tests\\TestIndex\n    - Firesphere\\SolrSearch\\Tests\\TestIndexTwo\n    - Firesphere\\SolrSearch\\Tests\\TestIndexThree\n```\n\nLooking at the `tests` folder, there is a `TestIndexFour`. This index is not loaded unless explicitly asked.\n\n----------\n<sup>1</sup> Although not required, it's highly recomended\n\n<sup>2</sup> The second option of an array can be omitted and directly given the boost value\n",

This should work fine for\nmost situations, even if you only have one core available. If you have more cores, you can make this\nnumber larger, of course.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>\n<p>Using all cores your system has, will make your website pretty slow during indexing!

For readability however, it’s better to use variables for Facets:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-php\">    protected $facetFields = [\n        RelatedObject::class   =&gt; [\n            'BaseClass' =&gt; SiteTree::class,\n            'Field'     =&gt; 'RelatedObjectID',\n            'Title'     =&gt; 'RelationOne'\n        ],\n        OtherRelatedObject::class =&gt; [\n            'BaseClass' =&gt; SiteTree::class,\n            'Field'     =&gt; 'OtherRelatedObjectID',\n            'Title'     =&gt; 'RelationTwo'\n        ]\n    ];\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will generate a facet field in Solr, assuming this relation exists on <code>SiteTree</code> or <code>Page</code>.</p>\n<p>The relation would look like <code>SiteTree_RelatedObjectID</code>, where <code>RelatedObject</code> the name of the relation reflects.</p>\n<p>The Title is used to group all facets by their Title, in the template, this is accessible by looping <code>$Result.FacetSet.TitleOfTheFacet</code></p>\n<h3 id=\"important-notice\">Important notice <a class=\"heading-anchor-permalink\" href=\"#important-notice\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Note, that Facets are relational. For faceting on a relation, omit the origin class (e.g. <code>SiteTree</code>), but supply the full relational\npath to the facet. e.g. if you want to have facets on <code>RelationObject-&gt;RelationThing()-&gt;Relation()-&gt;ID</code>, the Facet declaration should be\n<code>RelationObject.RelationThing.RelationID</code>. It should always end with an ID that is a <code>has_one</code> relation.</p>\n<p>Although it can be a <code>has_many</code> just as well, and it would be <code>Relation.ID</code>, it is not advised, as it creates a lot of overhead.</p>\n<p>It would and should work though. If you want to do it that way, there’s no stopping you, it’s just not advised.</p>\n<h2 id=\"accessing-solr\">Accessing Solr <a class=\"heading-anchor-permalink\" href=\"#accessing-solr\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If available, you can access your Solr instance at <code>http://mydomain.com:8983</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"excluding-unwanted-indexes\">Excluding unwanted indexes <a class=\"heading-anchor-permalink\" href=\"#excluding-unwanted-indexes\">#</a></h2>\n<p>To exclude unwanted indexes, it is possible declare a list of <em>wanted</em> indexes in the <code>YML</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">Firesphere\\SolrSearch\\Services\\SolrCoreService:\n  indexes:\n    - CircleCITestIndex\n    - Firesphere\\SolrSearch\\Tests\\TestIndex\n    - Firesphere\\SolrSearch\\Tests\\TestIndexTwo\n    - Firesphere\\SolrSearch\\Tests\\TestIndexThree\n</code></pre>\n<p>Looking at the <code>tests</code> folder, there is a <code>TestIndexFour</code>.

      "content": "# Contributing\n\nAny open source product is only as good as the community behind it. You can participate by sharing code, ideas, or simply helping others. No matter what your skill level is, every contribution counts.\n\n * [Sharing your opinion and raising issues](http://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/contributing/issues_and_bugs/)\n * [Providing code, whether it's creating a feature or fixing a bug](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/contributing/code/)\n\n## Signing commits\n\nIt is highly recommended to sign commits with your PGP key to ensure integrity.\n\n# Further notes\n\nParts of this contributing guidelines are taken from [Bitfield Script](https://github.com/bitfield/script/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#Documentation)\n\n## Documentation\n\nIt doesn't matter if you write the greatest piece of code in the history of the world, if no one knows it exists, or how to use it.\nWrite doc comments\n\nAny functions or methods you write should have useful documentation comments in the standard PHP Docblock format. Specifically, they should say what inputs the function takes, what it does (in detail), and what outputs it returns. If it returns an error value, explain under what circumstances this happens.\n\nFor example:\n```php\n/**\n * Method to enable predictive search\n * Gives the user a prediction on what it is trying to search for\n * @param string $searchTerm\n * @return ArrayList\n */\n```\nThis is the whole user manual for your code. It will be included in the autogenerated documentation for the whole package. Remember that readers will often see it without the accompanying code, so it needs to make sense on its own.\n\n## Write a use case\n\nThis is probably the most important thing to bear in mind. A great design principle for software libraries is \nto start with a real-world use case, and try to implement it using the feature you have in mind. \nNo issues or PRs will be accepted into script without an accompanying use case (See the project board). \nAnd I hold myself to that rule just as much as anybody else.\n\nWhat do I mean by \"use case\"? I mean a real problem that you or someone else actually has, that could be solved using the feature. \nFor example, you might think it's a very cool idea to add a Frobnicate() method to this module. \nMaybe it is, but what's it for? Where would this be used in the real world? Can you give an example of a \nproblem that could be solved by a program using Frobnicate()? If so, what would the program look like?\n\nThe reason for insisting on this up front is that it's much easier to design a feature the right way if you start \nwith its usage in mind. It's all too easy to design something in the abstract, and then find later that when you \ntry to use it in a program, the API is completely unsuitable.\n\nAnother reason for having a use case is that it gives us a useful example program,\nwhich can be included with the library to show how the feature is used.\n\nThe final reason is that it's tempting to over-elaborate a design and add all sorts of bells and whistles\nthat nobody actually wants. Simple APIs are best. If you think of an enhancement, \nbut it's not needed for your use case, leave it out. Things can always be enhanced later if necessary.\n\n## Update the docs\n\nAny change to the API should also be accompanied by an update to the docs. \nIf you add a new method, add it in the appropriate place (sources, filters, etc.), \nin its correct order alphabetically, and with a suitable (brief) example of its use.\n\n# Before submitting your pull request\n\nHere's a handy checklist for making sure your PR will be accepted as quickly as possible.\n\n - [ ] Have you opened an issue to discuss the feature and agree its general design?\n - [ ] Do you have a use case and, ideally, an example program using the feature?\n - [ ] Do you have tests covering 90%+ of the feature code (and, of course passing)\n - [ ] Have you written complete and accurate doc comments?\n - [ ] Have you updated the README, Documentation and its table of contents?\n - [ ] You rock. Thanks a lot.\n\n# After submitting your PR\n\nHere's a nice tip for PR-driven development in general. After you've submitted the PR, do a 'pre-code-review'. \nGo through the diffs, line by line, and be your own code reviewer. Does something look weird? \nIs something not quite straightforward? It's quite likely that you'll spot errors at this stage which you missed before, \nsimply because you're looking at the code with a reviewer's mindset.\n\nIf so, fix them! But if you can foresee a question from a code reviewer, comment on the code to answer it in advance. \n(Even better, improve the code so that the question doesn't arise.)\n\n# The code review process\n\nIf you've completed all these steps, I _will_ invest significant time and energy in giving your PR a detailed code review. \nThis is a powerful and beneficial process which can not only improve the code, but can also help you learn to be a better \nengineer and a better Go programmer—and the same goes for me!\n\n## Expect to be taken seriously\n\nDon't think of code review as a \"you got this wrong, fix it\" kind of conversation (this isn't a helpful review comment). \nInstead, think of it as a discussion where both sides can ask questions, make suggestions, clarify problems and misunderstandings, \ncatch mistakes, and add improvements.\n\nYou shouldn't be disappointed if you don't get a simple 'LGTM' and an instant merge. \nIf this is what you're used to, then your team isn't really doing code review to its full potential. \nInstead, the more comments you get, the more seriously it means I'm taking your work.

You may not agree with some of the code review comments. \nReviewing code is a delicate business in the first place, requiring diplomacy as well as discretion, \nbut responding to code reviews is also a skilled task.\n\nIf you find yourself reacting emotionally, take a break. Go walk in the woods for a while, \nor play with a laughing child. When you come back to the code, approach it as though it were someone else's, \nnot your own, and ask yourself seriously whether or not the reviewer _has a point_.\n\nIf you genuinely think the reviewer has just misunderstood something, or made a mistake, \ntry to clarify the issue. Ask questions, don't make accusations. Remember that every project has a certain way of doing things, \nwhich may not be your way. It's polite to go along with these practices and conventions.\n\nYou may feel as though you're doing the project maintainer a favour by contributing, as indeed you are, \nbut an open source project is like somebody's home.

It's not just a case of skim-reading the diffs. \nThe reviewer will need to check out your branch, run the tests, think carefully about what you've done, \nmake suggestions, test alternatives.

Specifically, they should say what inputs the function takes, what it does (in detail), and what outputs it returns. If it returns an error value, explain under what circumstances this happens.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-php\">/**\n * Method to enable predictive search\n * Gives the user a prediction on what it is trying to search for\n * @param string $searchTerm\n * @return ArrayList\n */\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is the whole user manual for your code. It will be included in the autogenerated documentation for the whole package. Remember that readers will often see it without the accompanying code, so it needs to make sense on its own.</p>\n<h2 id=\"write-a-use-case\">Write a use case <a class=\"heading-anchor-permalink\" href=\"#write-a-use-case\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This is probably the most important thing to bear in mind. A great design principle for software libraries is\nto start with a real-world use case, and try to implement it using the feature you have in mind.\nNo issues or PRs will be accepted into script without an accompanying use case (See the project board).\nAnd I hold myself to that rule just as much as anybody else.</p>\n<p>What do I mean by “use case”? I mean a real problem that you or someone else actually has, that could be solved using the feature.\nFor example, you might think it’s a very cool idea to add a Frobnicate() method to this module.\nMaybe it is, but what’s it for? Where would this be used in the real world? Can you give an example of a\nproblem that could be solved by a program using Frobnicate()? If so, what would the program look like?</p>\n<p>The reason for insisting on this up front is that it’s much easier to design a feature the right way if you start\nwith its usage in mind. It’s all too easy to design something in the abstract, and then find later that when you\ntry to use it in a program, the API is completely unsuitable.</p>\n<p>Another reason for having a use case is that it gives us a useful example program,\nwhich can be included with the library to show how the feature is used.</p>\n<p>The final reason is that it’s tempting to over-elaborate a design and add all sorts of bells and whistles\nthat nobody actually wants. Simple APIs are best. If you think of an enhancement,\nbut it’s not needed for your use case, leave it out. Things can always be enhanced later if necessary.</p>\n<h2 id=\"update-the-docs\">Update the docs <a class=\"heading-anchor-permalink\" href=\"#update-the-docs\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Any change to the API should also be accompanied by an update to the docs.\nIf you add a new method, add it in the appropriate place (sources, filters, etc.),\nin its correct order alphabetically, and with a suitable (brief) example of its use.</p>\n<h1 id=\"before-submitting-your-pull-request\">Before submitting your pull request <a class=\"heading-anchor-permalink\" href=\"#before-submitting-your-pull-request\">#</a></h1>\n<p>Here’s a handy checklist for making sure your PR will be accepted as quickly as possible.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[ ] Have you opened an issue to discuss the feature and agree its general design?</li>\n<li>[ ] Do you have a use case and, ideally, an example program using the feature?</li>\n<li>[ ] Do you have tests covering 90%+ of the feature code (and, of course passing)</li>\n<li>[ ] Have you written complete and accurate doc comments?</li>\n<li>[ ] Have you updated the README, Documentation and its table of contents?</li>\n<li>[ ] You rock. Thanks a lot.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"after-submitting-your-pr\">After submitting your PR <a class=\"heading-anchor-permalink\" href=\"#after-submitting-your-pr\">#</a></h1>\n<p>Here’s a nice tip for PR-driven development in general. After you’ve submitted the PR, do a ‘pre-code-review’.\nGo through the diffs, line by line, and be your own code reviewer. Does something look weird?\nIs something not quite straightforward? It’s quite likely that you’ll spot errors at this stage which you missed before,\nsimply because you’re looking at the code with a reviewer’s mindset.</p>\n<p>If so, fix them! But if you can foresee a question from a code reviewer, comment on the code to answer it in advance.\n(Even better, improve the code so that the question doesn’t arise.)</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-code-review-process\">The code review process <a class=\"heading-anchor-permalink\" href=\"#the-code-review-process\">#</a></h1>\n<p>If you’ve completed all these steps, I <em>will</em> invest significant time and energy in giving your PR a detailed code review.\nThis is a powerful and beneficial process which can not only improve the code, but can also help you learn to be a better\nengineer and a better Go programmer—and the same goes for me!</p>\n<h2 id=\"expect-to-be-taken-seriously\">Expect to be taken seriously <a class=\"heading-anchor-permalink\" href=\"#expect-to-be-taken-seriously\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Don’t think of code review as a “you got this wrong, fix it” kind of conversation (this isn’t a helpful review comment).\nInstead, think of it as a discussion where both sides can ask questions, make suggestions, clarify problems and misunderstandings,\ncatch mistakes, and add improvements.</p>\n<p>You shouldn’t be disappointed if you don’t get a simple ‘LGTM’ and an instant merge.\nIf this is what you’re used to, then your team isn’t really doing code review to its full potential.\nInstead, the more comments you get, the more seriously it means I’m taking your work. Where appropriate,\nI’ll say what I liked as well as what I’d like to see improved.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dealing-with-comments\">Dealing with comments <a class=\"heading-anchor-permalink\" href=\"#dealing-with-comments\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Now comes the tricky bit.

Solr does not have\nthe correct write permissions, and Apache does not have the correct write permissions either.\n\nThis can be resolved by setting the folder of your Solr Core to `/var/solr/data`.\n\nThen, create the following subfolders in the data folder:\n- `YourCoreName/conf`\n- `YourCoreName/data`\n\nThen, add the `solr` user to the `apache` group (or `www-data`)\nAnd the other way around, add apache to solr.\n\nChange the ownership of the whole `YourCoreName` folder to `solr:apache`.\n\nChange the permissions on `YourCoreName/conf` to be `777`.\n\nThis should, in theory, resolve your permission errors.\n\nThese errors are _not_ related to this module, but on how Vagrant is set up on Linux.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThe name of your apache user could be different, so make sure you get it right.\nAfter updating the group permissions, be sure to log out and back in again.\n\n## Solr and Vagrant issues, pt. 2\n\nIt's also known that Solr won't properly reload cores on Vagrant VM's. This is outside\nof control for this module, it is advised to restart Solr before and after a config change.\n\n## Solr is running as the wrong user\n\nFor yet unknown reasons, even after following the Solr installation guide, it may happen\nthat Solr runs as the wrong user.\n\nIf this happens, the best course of action is to stop Solr and start it with the correct user:\n`cd /opt/solr-8.3.1 && sudo -u solr ./bin/solr start`\n\nWhere `8.3.1` should reflect your current Solr version. Or, if you've allowed Solr to create\nsymlinks, the path could be `/opt/solr`.\n\n## Facets do not show anymore since the latest version\n\nYep, the `XML` switch to non-deprecated options, which causes facets and filters to not work properly anymore.\nPlease re-index your Solr Core `vendor/bin/sake dev/tasks/SolrConfigureTask flush=all` followed\nby `vendor/bin/sake dev/tasks/SolrIndexTask` from terminal is the most efficient way.\n\nThis is caused by a deprecated change in the Integer field on Solr level and can not be fixed in any\nother way.\n\n## Localhost?\n\nYes, for now, the config requires the host's name to be `localhost`. This is not exactly by choice,\nbut due to how Solarium works. Stay tuned for updates.\n\n## My config is written to the wrong folder (`.solr`)\n\nThis is probably due to an older version of this module, that had this bug. Please upgrade.\n\n## I can't get it to work on Live or UAT\n\nWe're very sorry, but deployments of Solr differ so much per deployment, that we can't\ngive any solid advice.\n\nThe best answer right now is following these steps:\n- Install Solr as described in [Install Solr](../02-Solr.md)\n- Make sure the `data` folder is executable fully by Solr (`rxd` on Linux)\n- Make sure the `data/conf` folder is writeable by your PHP and the webserver (Apache2/Nginx/Caddy/Lighttpd etc.)\n- Run a local test of the live environment, ensuring all configs are good to go\n- If there are still errors, please contact your own sysadmin team first. They are most likely to be able to\nresolve the problem\n\n### To no avail, no solution worked\n\nIf it is related to the module, and not related to actual permissions or other server set-up issues, and you\n can not make a public issue, you can contact us at\n \n`solr[@]casa-laguna[.]net`\n\nPlease note that we may charge you for investigating and helping solve your issues. This module is FOSS, but\nour time is not unlimited and we may feel an issue is not worth the effort unless we get paid for our time.\n",

Or, if you’ve allowed Solr to create\nsymlinks, the path could be <code>/opt/solr</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"facets-do-not-show-anymore-since-the-latest-version\">Facets do not show anymore since the latest version <a class=\"heading-anchor-permalink\" href=\"#facets-do-not-show-anymore-since-the-latest-version\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Yep, the <code>XML</code> switch to non-deprecated options, which causes facets and filters to not work properly anymore.\nPlease re-index your Solr Core <code>vendor/bin/sake dev/tasks/SolrConfigureTask flush=all</code> followed\nby <code>vendor/bin/sake dev/tasks/SolrIndexTask</code> from terminal is the most efficient way.</p>\n<p>This is caused by a deprecated change in the Integer field on Solr level and can not be fixed in any\nother way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"localhost%3F\">Localhost? <a class=\"heading-anchor-permalink\" href=\"#localhost%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Yes, for now, the config requires the host’s name to be <code>localhost</code>. This is not exactly by choice,\nbut due to how Solarium works. Stay tuned for updates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-config-is-written-to-the-wrong-folder-(.solr)\">My config is written to the wrong folder (<code>.solr</code>) <a class=\"heading-anchor-permalink\" href=\"#my-config-is-written-to-the-wrong-folder-(.solr)\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This is probably due to an older version of this module, that had this bug. Please upgrade.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-can%E2%80%99t-get-it-to-work-on-live-or-uat\">I can’t get it to work on Live or UAT <a class=\"heading-anchor-permalink\" href=\"#i-can%E2%80%99t-get-it-to-work-on-live-or-uat\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We’re very sorry, but deployments of Solr differ so much per deployment, that we can’t\ngive any solid advice.</p>\n<p>The best answer right now is following these steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Install Solr as described in <a href=\"../02-Solr.html\">Install Solr</a></li>\n<li>Make sure the <code>data</code> folder is executable fully by Solr (<code>rxd</code> on Linux)</li>\n<li>Make sure the <code>data/conf</code> folder is writeable by your PHP and the webserver (Apache2/Nginx/Caddy/Lighttpd etc.)</li>\n<li>Run a local test of the live environment, ensuring all configs are good to go</li>\n<li>If there are still errors, please contact your own sysadmin team first. They are most likely to be able to\nresolve the problem</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"to-no-avail%2C-no-solution-worked\">To no avail, no solution worked <a class=\"heading-anchor-permalink\" href=\"#to-no-avail%2C-no-solution-worked\">#</a></h3>\n<p>If it is related to the module, and not related to actual permissions or other server set-up issues, and you\ncan not make a public issue, you can contact us at</p>\n<p><code>solr[@]casa-laguna[.]net</code></p>\n<p>Please note that we may charge you for investigating and helping solve your issues.
